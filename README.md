## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I've been offered an internship in the analytical department at Yandex Afisha. My project aims to conduct a comprehensive cohort analysis for Yandex Afisha, an online platform for buying tickets to cinemas, theaters, and concerts. The analysis will focus on understanding how customers interact with the product, their purchasing behavior, the revenue they generate, and the time it takes for them to become profitable.

By dividing the user base into cohorts based on their signup or initial purchase dates, we will be able to track the behavior and performance of different groups over time. The analysis will involve exploring various metrics such as user engagement, conversion rates, average revenue per user, and payback periods.

Through this project, we will gain valuable insights into user lifecycles, identifying key milestones such as when users start making purchases and how their spending patterns evolve. These insights will enable the marketing department to optimize their strategies, allocate resources effectively, and improve the overall profitability of Yandex Afisha.

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to conduct a cohort analysis for Yandex Afisha, with the following key goals:

- Understand user behavior: Identify patterns and trends in how users interact with the platform, including their engagement levels, retention rates, and conversion rates.
- Determine the user lifecycle: Determine when users start making purchases after signing up and track their spending patterns over time.
- Assess customer value: Calculate the average revenue generated by each customer and identify high-value customer segments.
- Analyze payback periods: Determine the time it takes for customers to become profitable and assess the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide actionable insights that will guide the optimization of marketing expenses at Yandex Afisha, leading to improved ROI and overall business performance.
